# Emotion Recognition By DEAP Dataset

This is the repository of my final year project: Emotion Recognition By DEAP Dataset.
The project uses [DEAP](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/mmv/datasets/deap/index.html) i.e. Database for Emotion Analysis using Physiological signals. This database comprises of two parts: dataset of EEG signals and corresponding videos of particpants. For more details visit [here](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/mmv/datasets/deap/readme.html).

The aim of the project is to achieve state of the art accuracy in classifying emotions based on the EEG signals. We began by implementing the basic classification techniques outlined in the original [paper](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/mmv/datasets/deap/doc/tac_special_issue_2011.pdf). After the initial literature survey, we also implemented some of the papers that build on our aim. 

Currently, we are working on various optimization algorithms to obtain higher accuracy. 
Note: This repo is not yet complete as the project is underway right now.
